Module      : Syntax.Timing
Description : Timing annotations for references to storage variables. In the source code, a 
              reference to a storage variable can be explicitly time with `Pre` or `Post` or 
              implicitly timed (`Neither`). After typing, in aa separate `annotate` pass, all
              timing are made explicit.

-- | This will never be used as-is. Its only purpose is to use with -XDataKinds,
-- to distinguish between those AST terms which have fully explicit timings ('Timed')
-- and those which have implicit timings.
