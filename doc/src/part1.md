# What is Act?
<!-- paper abstract -->
Act, a formal specification language and verification framework for proving the correctness of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contracts. Act specifications precisely describe all possible behaviors of a smart contract in a high-level language and are automatically verified against the contract’s EVM bytecode using symbolic execution.
